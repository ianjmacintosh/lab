  <h1>Showing a Footer on Mobile</h1>
  <p>
    The year is 2024, I'm adding a footer to a wicked simple page so it shows up on the bottom of the screen on desktop and mobile, and it's a lot harder than I expected.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're just looking for a solution: use <code>#page-content { min-height: 100dvh; }</code> <button>Copy to Clipboard</button> (<a href="example05.html">View live example</a>)
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to learn more, I'll show you some other approaches that didn't do what I had in mind.

    These pages are best viewed on mobile so you can see for yourself how each change affects the page display, but I'll include some screenshots from iOS and Android anyway.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Step 1: CSS grid (<code>rows: 1fr auto</code>) and <code>min-height: vh100</code></li>
    <li>Step 2: Remove the margin, add padding, apply box-sizing everywhere</li>
    <li>Step 3: <code>padding-bottom: calc(10px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom)</code></li>
    <li>Step 4: Update the meta viewport tag with <code>viewport-fit=cover</code></li>
    <li>Step 5: Use <code>min-height: 100dvh</code> -- problem solved</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Don't forget to add page code!</p>
